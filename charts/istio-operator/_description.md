The [Istio Operator](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/operator/) provides a declarative _Kubernetes_ native way to manage [Istio](https://istio.io/) via `IstioOperator` custom resources.

[Istio](https://istio.io/) extends Kubernetes to establish a programmable, application-aware network using the powerful _Envoy_ service proxy. Working with both _Kubernetes_ and traditional workloads, _Istio_ brings standard, universal traffic management, telemetry, and security to complex deployments.
